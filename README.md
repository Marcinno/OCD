# About
OCD (Open Car Diagnostic) is my engineer thesis

## Why?
I'm interested in vehicle and i want to raise awareness about driving. All people who want analysing car's data from OBDII connector can download OCD and use it. 

## Next steps
Now OCD it's a alpha test project. Application have a error handling, proper data flow but haven't any unit testing, all car model support and it isn't reading-out DTC's.
In feature we want to:
*Add GPS signal
*Reading-out DTC's
*Assistance all cars
*Make a system to safe a car
