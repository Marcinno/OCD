# About

OCD (Open Car Diagnostic) is my engineer thesis

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install : 

```bash
pip install obd
pip install psycopg2
```

## Why?
I'm interested in vehicle and I want to raise awareness about driving. All people who want analysing car's data from OBDII connector can download OCD and use it.


## Next steps
Now OCD it's a alpha test project. Application have a error handling, proper data flow but haven't any unit testing, all car model support and isn't reading-out DTC's.
In feature we want to:
```python
Add GPS signal
Reading-out DTC's
Assistance all cars
Make a system to safe a car
